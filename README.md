Morphology:

=>Morphology is a broad set of image processing operations that process images based on shapes. In a morphological operation, the value of each pixel in the output image is based on a comparison of the corresponding pixel in the input image with its neighbors.

=>Morphological operations apply structuring element (kernel) to an input image , creating an output image of same size.
